1. how to filter gene into the final plot (nuclei have been filtered already in the data)
2. Scale data based on the 14963 profiles (?) 
  * already passed >10,000 reads and >200 genes threshold for these nuclei 
  * this means parts of the data (not all the data)
3. got the data from two sources: 
  * single cell portal 
  * GTEx 
  * no diff between these two sources 
4. cmp with https://portals.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/dronc-seq-single-nucleus-rna-seq-on-human-archived-brain
  * cells in each cluster not match (Solved - fitered few clusters)
  * total is 14693 in my side but not in the web page (filter genes needed - most variable genes?)

  1. # of Nuclei in each cluster are slightly different from single_Cell_portal
